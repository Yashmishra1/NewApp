    "neighborhood_overview": "Kreuzk\u00f6lln is the new very trendy area with lots of bars, restaurants and cultural events right outside the door, so you don\u00b4t even need to move to get a real shot of the Berlin feel. The street is very lively and there are caf\u00e9es, bars and new project spaces opening every month in this district. Also you can find cosy ice cream parlors, great turkish food, Japanese ramen, the best place for Burgers in Kreuzberg, and also the place known for 20 years for serving the best French croissants right outside the doorstep. The area has gone through a very fast gentrification and the street is filled with very popular bars and restaurants. This is perfect for having access to good food right outside the door, but also in the night the street can be a little bit loud, as the pulse of the city streams into the apartment. The bed facing the backyard, the one on the podium, is more quiet and makes it possible to shut of the street life.",
    "notes": null,
    "transit": "The U7 and U8 from Hermannplatz takes you in all kind of directions in the city. Hermannplatz is 7 min walk from the apartment, along the cozy Weserstrasse, also filled with nice bars and caf\u00e9s. There are also busses within 2 min walk from the apartment that takes you in almost any direction in the city.",
    "access": "Guests have access to the large bedroom. This is the room with the  entrance to the balcony and that partly has a floating structure of the same material as the podium on parts of the floor. The room with the chandelier on the pictures I use as my bedroom/studio when I have guests. The guests then have private acccess to their own bedroom, the bathroom, the balcony and the main room with the kitchen/podium. I close off the room with the chandelier as my private living/workspace.",
    "interaction": "I work a lot, so I sit a lot in my studio, but I also am a very social person, so we might see eachother little or more depending on my timeschedule. I am always willing to give tips about Berlin if the guests need it.",
    "house_rules": "The apartment is a unique project and is very dear to me, and it is represented in architect magazines and competitions, so it is important that anyone staying here with me conciders the house rules and takes good care of the place. The place is suitable as a silent retreat from the city, rather than a place for a party. The material that the podium is made of is a bit vulnerable and very expensive to replace, it can\u00b4t have water lying on it for a long time without getting damaged, it is not heat proof like concrete is, and gets scratches if furniture is moved over it with sharp edges. But using the apartment with a careful touch just gets you in even closer contact with the architecture, enjoy!",
